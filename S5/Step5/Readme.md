Assignment : 

To get 99.4 accuracy in MNIST dataset within 10k params and epochs <= 15.

Target:

Increase test accuracy to 99.4

Changes Done:

Added GAP

Add Image Augumentaion.

Update the kernels/convolutions to change the capacity.

Results: 

Parameters: 9,668

Best Train Accuracy: 99.12

Best Test Accuracy: 99.49(12th Epoch)

Analysis:

The model gets test accuracy of more than 99.4.The test accuracy seems to be consistent. The model is underfitting as we made the train dataset harder.
