Assignment : 

To get 99.4 accuracy in MNIST dataset within 10k params and epochs <= 15.

Target:

Increase test accuracy to 99.4

Changes Done:

Added GAP

Reduce the Epochs to 15.

Add Image Augumentaion.

Update the kernels/convolutions to achieve the accuracy.

Results: 

Parameters: 7,448

Best Train Accuracy: 98.92

Best Test Accuracy: 99.43(15th Epoch)

Analysis:

The model gets test accuracy of 99.37, 99.4 and 99.43 in the last three epochs. The test accuracy seems to be consistent.
