Target:

Get the basic skeleton right.
To get less than 10 K parameters.
Changes Done: Changed the size of kernels to get the required parameters.

Results:

Total params: 7,180
Best Train Accuracy: 98.19
Best Test Accuracy: 98.28
Analysis: Getting parameters in range but we need to improve accuracy.
